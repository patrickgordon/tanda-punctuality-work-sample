# To run this server, you'll need to install Sinatra - a Ruby gem (library) for webservers. http://www.sinatrarb.com/
#
# Once you've installed Ruby, you can install Sinatra by running `gem install sinatra`.
#
# The `require` lines below tell Ruby what other libraries are required by this program. All other libraries listed
# here are part of Ruby's standard library and shouldn't require additional installation.
#
# Once you have installed your dependencies, you can run the server by running `ruby punctuality.rb` from the directory
# this file lives in. You should see output that looks like this:
#
# YourComputerName:punctuality yourname$ ruby punctuality.rb
# Puma 2.14.0 starting...
# * Min threads: 0, max threads: 16
# * Environment: development
# * Listening on tcp://localhost:4567
# == Sinatra (v1.4.7) has taken the stage on 4567 for development
#
# Test that it's working by going to http://localhost:4567/ (the port number is from the Sinatra output just above)
# Read the code to see other URLs you can access. Look at the data files for valid data ranges.
# 
# If you come across issues getting this code to run, please document the issues and how you fixed them - we'd love
# to see your thought process (and also fix it for others in future!)
