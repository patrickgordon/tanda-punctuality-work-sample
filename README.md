# TANDA Work Sample (Front-end) 

This is my attempt at the 'punctuality' work sample for TANDA. It uses a variety of modern front-end tech to deliver the requirements.

It has been built as a "Single Page App" (SPA) but could just be also integrated in to a more traditional web app.

#### Requirements to run:
* npm@
* sinatra@

#### Steps to get started
1. Install Sinatra-cross_origin: `gem install sinatra-cross_origin`
2. Install dependencies, in root directory run: `npm install`
3. Run sinatra server - `cd sinatra_web_server && ruby punctuality.rb`
4. Run the front end - `npm run dev`
5. Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### Technology:
* React
* Redux
* Webpack
* React-router

#### Noteworthy packages used
* [react-redux-starter-kit](linkhere)
* [redux-api-middleware](linkhere)
* [react-bootstrap](linkhere)
* [react-bootstrap-table](linkhere)

#### Comments on Implementation
* explain the use of selectors
* extra functionality - bad data highlighted rows
